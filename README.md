# Commitment
Tiny app to retrieve and list GitHub users by date of last commit/push.

## Purpose
Created for [Access Code 2.1](http://www.c4q.nyc/accesscode) to help with student metrics,
but if you find it useful, I'd love to hear about your use case.

## Usage
Supply GitHub API credentials and a list of GitHub usernames via environment variables.
Will display a list of users ranked by recent commits.
